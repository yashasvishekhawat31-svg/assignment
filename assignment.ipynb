        "Ans.The with statement in Python is used to handle files safely and efficiently by automatically managing resources. When you open a file using with, Python ensures the file is closed automatically, even if an error occurs inside the block. This prevents resource leaks, makes code cleaner, and eliminates the need to manually call file.close(), making file handling more reliable and easier to read."

        "Ans.Multithreading uses multiple threads within the same process, sharing the same memory space, making it useful for tasks that involve waiting (like I/O operations), but it is limited by Python’s GIL for CPU-heavy tasks. Multiprocessing uses multiple separate processes, each with its own memory space, allowing true parallel execution and making it better for CPU-intensive tasks, though it requires more memory and overhead than multithreading."

        "Ques 11.What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "Ans.Memory management in Python refers to how Python automatically allocates, manages, and frees memory while a program runs. It uses a private heap to store objects, a built-in garbage collector to remove unused objects, and reference counting to track how many variables point to each object. This automatic system ensures efficient use of memory without requiring the programmer to manually allocate or deallocate it."

        "Ans.Memory management is important in Python because it ensures efficient use of system memory, prevents programs from consuming unnecessary resources, and avoids issues like memory leaks or crashes. Proper memory handling keeps programs running smoothly, improves performance, and allows Python to automatically free unused objects so developers don’t have to manage memory manually."

        "Ques 15.How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "Ans.Python’s garbage collection system automatically manages memory using two mechanisms: reference counting, which immediately frees objects when their reference count drops to zero, and a cyclic garbage collector, which periodically identifies and removes groups of objects involved in circular references that are no longer in use. Together, these processes ensure efficient memory usage without requiring developers to manually free memory."
